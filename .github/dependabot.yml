  # =============================================================================
  # GO MODULES CONFIGURATION WITH GROUPING
  # =============================================================================
  # Using groups to combine all Go module updates into fewer PRs.
  # Note: Groups work within each package-ecosystem entry, so we separate:
  # - Main modules (root, api, properties, tests/e2e)
  # - Third-party modules (all third_party/* directories)
  #
  # Current go.mod files detected:
  # - / (root)
